Production-or-Publish License v1.0

Copyright (c) 2025 Yu-Chan Chen
All rights reserved.

This is a source-available license. It is NOT an OSI-approved open source license.

1. Acceptance

    By copying, modifying, distributing, or using the Licensed Work, You agree to be bound by this
    license. If You do not agree, do not use the Licensed Work.

    The permissions granted under this license are expressly conditioned on Your compliance with all
    terms and conditions herein.

2. Definitions

    "Licensed Work" means the software and source code contained in this repository, including any
    files, build scripts, configuration, and documentation distributed with it.

    "Licensor" means the copyright holder(s) of the Licensed Work, including the person or entity
    identified by the copyright notice above.

    "Upstream Repository" means the original public repository designated by the Licensor for the
    Licensed Work:
    https://github.com/funwilliam/Inventory-QR

    If the Upstream Repository URL changes, the Licensor may designate a new Upstream Repository in a
    prominent notice in the repository (e.g., README). Such designation applies prospectively.

    "You" means any individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this license.

    "Production Use" means any use by or for the benefit of a company, organization, or other legal
    entity (including internal use) in connection with its actual business operations, including use to
    record, track, manage, audit, or make decisions about real assets, inventory, equipment, materials,
    customers, orders, or internal operational processes, regardless of whether the software is
    accessed via a network/intranet/Internet or used fully offline/on-device.

    "Non-Production Use" means evaluation, learning, personal use, or demonstrations that do not
    constitute Production Use.

    For avoidance of doubt, Non-Production Use includes time-limited internal evaluation or testing
    that (i) does not record or operate on real business assets/workflows and (ii) does not produce
    outputs used for operational business decisions.

    "Fork" means any copy, modification, or derivative work of the Licensed Work.

    "Deployment" includes integrating the Licensed Work or a Fork with any organization system or
    workflow (including databases, identity systems, internal APIs, proprietary UIs, or deployment
    pipelines), and/or modifying it for such integration.

    "Corresponding Source" means the preferred form of the work for making modifications, including
    all source code, build scripts/configuration, packaging/deployment configuration, and dependency
    manifests necessary to produce the deployed artifact by an authorized user with lawful access to
    any excluded third-party materials.

    "Your Modifications" means any modifications, enhancements, patches, bug fixes, or derivative works
    you create that are based on or incorporate the Licensed Work.

    "First Production Use Date" means the first calendar date on which You (or anyone acting on Your
    behalf) begins Production Use. For avoidance of doubt, it is the earliest date on which the
    Licensed Work or a Fork is first used to record, track, or operate on real business assets or real
    operational workflows, or the earliest date on which its outputs are first used for operational
    business decisions.

    "Ceased Production Use" means You have stopped all Production Use of the Licensed Work, any Fork,
    and any Deployment across your organization. If You later resume Production Use at any time, You
    must again satisfy option (A) or option (B) at that time.

    "Public Repository" means a git repository that is publicly accessible for viewing and cloning
    without requiring individualized access approval (e.g., not restricted to a closed group or by
    case-by-case whitelisting), and that contains the complete Corresponding Source required by this
    license.

3. Non-Production Grant (free)

    Subject to the terms of this license, You may copy, modify, and redistribute the Licensed Work for
    Non-Production Use.

    Production Use: Choose ONE path

4. For Production Use, You must satisfy ONE of the following:

    (A) Paid Commercial License
    You have obtained a paid commercial license from the Licensor under separate written terms.

    OR

    (B) Publish-to-Git (no charge)
    Within 14 days of the First Production Use Date, You must:

    1) Publish the complete Corresponding Source of Your Fork (including all modifications to the
        Licensed Work) in a Public Repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or any publicly accessible git
        hosting); and

    2) License that Public Repository under GNU GPL v3.0 (GPL-3.0-only); and

        If You are unable or unwilling to license Your Fork under GPL-3.0-only, You must choose
        option (A) instead.

    3) Keep the Public Repository publicly accessible for as long as You continue Production Use.

        After You have Ceased Production Use, You may make the repository private or remove it.
        If You later resume Production Use, You must again satisfy option (A) or option (B) at that
        time.

        If You resume Production Use after having Ceased Production Use, the deadlines in option (B)
        (including the 14-day publication requirement and the notice requirement) apply again from
        the date You resume Production Use.

    4) Retain this LICENSE file and all copyright notices; and

    5) Include clear, reproducible build/packaging instructions sufficient to produce the deployed
        artifact from source (a README is acceptable); and

    6) Provide NOTICE to the Licensor:
        - Within 3 business days after publishing the Public Repository (or as soon as reasonably
        practicable if a hosting platform outage or similar circumstance prevents timely posting),
        You must notify the Licensor by opening an issue on the Upstream Repository with the title:
            "Production-or-Publish License Compliance Notice: <Organization Name>"
        The issue body must include:
            a) the URL of the Public Repository;
            b) the First Production Use Date;
            c) the Organization name (legal entity) and a contact GitHub account.

        If opening an issue is not possible (e.g., issues disabled), You must instead provide the
        same notice via a contact method designated by the Licensor in the Upstream Repository
        (e.g., email address in README). If no contact method is designated, You must publish the
        notice in the Public Repository README under a section titled
        "Production-or-Publish License Compliance Notice" with the same required fields.

        Notice is deemed given on the date it is publicly posted (issue or README) or emailed to
        the designated contact method, whichever is applicable.

    Third-party dependencies note (option B):
    If Your Fork depends on third-party materials that You are not legally permitted to publish
    (e.g., proprietary SDKs, paid assets), 
    You must:
        i) exclude only those materials from the Public Repository; and
        ii) clearly document how an authorized user can obtain them; and
        iii) ensure the remaining published source is sufficient to reproduce the deployed artifact by
        an authorized user.

    This exception may not be used to withhold Your Modifications to the Licensed Work.

    Contribution License-Back (required for option B):
    By choosing option (B), You grant the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable,
    non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of,
    and distribute Your Modifications, and to sublicense Your Modifications under any terms,
    including proprietary/commercial terms.

    This grant applies only to the extent You have rights in Your Modifications and does not
    override third-party rights.

    By choosing option (B), You represent that You have the right to grant the above license for
    Your Modifications.

    If You do not meet (A) or (B), You do not have permission for Production Use.

5. Notices and attribution

    You must not remove or alter copyright notices in the Licensed Work.
    You may add Your own notices for Your Modifications.

6. No trademark rights

    This license does not grant any rights to use any trademarks, logos, or brand features of the
    Licensor or any contributors.

7. No patent rights

    No patent rights are granted under this license.

    For clarity: Section 6 applies to the Licensed Work as provided under this license. If You choose
    option (B), Your Fork is licensed under GPL-3.0-only, and patent-related rights, if any, are
    governed by GPL-3.0-only for that Fork.

8. Disclaimer of warranty

    THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

9. Limitation of liability

    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
    CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE,
    ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSED WORK OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS
    IN THE LICENSED WORK.

10. Termination and reinstatement

    10.1 Termination
        Any violation of this license automatically terminates the permissions granted to You.

    10.2 Reinstatement (cure)
        If You cease the violation and come into full compliance within 30 days of the earlier of:
            (i) Your receipt of notice of the violation from the Licensor; or
            (ii) the date You knew or reasonably should have known of the violation,
                the permissions granted to You are automatically reinstated.

        Automatic reinstatement does not apply if this is the third (or more) violation by You within
        any rolling 12-month period. In that case, reinstatement requires the Licensor’s explicit
        written permission or a separate paid commercial license.

    10.3 Effect of termination
        Upon termination, You must immediately stop all Production Use unless and until You obtain
        a paid commercial license or fully satisfy option (B) while Production Use continues.

11. Governing law and venue

    This license is governed by the laws of Taiwan (Republic of China), excluding conflict-of-law
    principles. Any dispute arising from this license shall be submitted to the Taipei District Court
    as the court of first instance, unless mandatory law provides otherwise.

12. Severability

    If any provision of this license is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in
    full force and effect.

13. Entire license

    This license constitutes the entire agreement regarding the Licensed Work, unless You have a
    separate written commercial license with the Licensor.
